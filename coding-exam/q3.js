/*
The substring method in JS is a string method that would get a part of a string based on the index values provided. 
Ex. let str1 = "Hello World"
str1.substring(3, 8) -> "lo Wo"
Create a function that would simulate the behavior of the substring method.
Specifications:
1. Any string method CANNOT be used.
2. If the first argument is bigger than the second, flip the values
3. If the second argument is more than the length of the string, return up to the end of the string.
4. If the first argument is less than 0, it is treated as zero.
